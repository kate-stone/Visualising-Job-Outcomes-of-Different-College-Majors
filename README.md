# Visualising Job Outcomes of Different College Majors

Each year millions of students are faced with the anxiety inducing process of choosing a major field of study. With a plethora of opportunites out there, identifying the best path can be challenging. This is why it is important for students to research and carefully analyse their options. Apart from choosing a major that matches their natural talents and interests, students should consider the following:
- Salary expectations; 
- Under-employment rates in the field;
- Unemployment rates in the field; and
- Whether or not going to college is really necessary for their chosen career.

In this project I'll explore majors of US students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012 using data from surveys conducted by American Community Survey. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the data from these surveys and made it available on their Github [repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors). Using visualisations, I'll explore questions from the dataset including:

- Which majors and major categories have the highest and lowest median salaries? 
- Which majors and major categories have the lowest and highest unemployement rates?
- Which majors and major categories have the lowest and highest under-employement rates?
- Which majors and major categories have the lowest and highest rates of graduates in jobs that don't require a degree?
- How do majors that are predominantly male compare to majors that are predominantly female?
- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
